# Description of your program (part 7)

First, you have to import the document file into your program.
Next, you have to establish a scanner element to be able to parse your document.
Create a mutable integer variable to represent your word count, and establish the variable at 0.
Write a function that follows the logic of: "While there is a next word in the document, move the scanner to the next word and increase the word count variable by 1."
The function will cycle through the document until there are no words left.
By the time the function completes, the counter variable will equal the number of words in the document.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

It was actually a little hard for me. I know how to code, but I haven't done it in quite a while. I've been
thinking in a much more design-oriented way for the past year or so because of my coursework, so going back
to the logic and procedural thinking of code requires my brain to switch gears a bit. I'm just a little out
of practice (plus I've never done code in Python), but I'm looking forward to getting a refresher and being
more proficient at the end of the quarter.
